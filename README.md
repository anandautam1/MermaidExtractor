# MermaidExtractor
This project inspired on the lack of tool on making a tabular form of Mermaid UML data.
It is simple python script on extracting mermaid (firstly for gantt chart) to generate a desired excel file for project management.
We have this beaultiful UML diagram based timeline from mermaid:

But we want to convert it to excel because your supervisor said ... this is kinda useless if its not tabulated and nicely formatted .... 
So ........ the project comes about because of this dilema on easier project management ... 

## How to get started 
I used windows ubuntu environment so everything will work 'technically' for linux
1. Clone the repo on linux so `git clone https://github.com/anandautam1/MermaidExtractor`
2. Just get started on the virtualenv so `venv/bin/activate`
3. Then run the script via `python ./extractor.py`
4. Voila your beautiful mermaid gantt chart turns into an Excel file you can use for project management
